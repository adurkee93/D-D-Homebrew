			<p>When the battle’s over, the average party leaves the most valuable loot behind. The Coriumancer recognizes the innate power of flesh, and utilizes their skill to empower their party with the abilities of their defeated foes. The Coriumancer’s expertise allows them to moonlight as a healer as well. </p>

Besides the innate prepared spells of the subclass, you can no longer prepare Artificer spells normally. Instead, you may prepare only spells for which you have a coriumancy catalyst in your possession.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you acquire the ability to create a basic coriumancy catalyst, a non-magical item derived from a fresh corpse or living body. You must have appropriate tools and proficiency to harvest the specimen. The creature of origin must be of the same or lower level as you, and the catalyst must be properly extracted from the creature. Basic catalysts have a decay rate, with items made from flesh and blood becoming invalid faster than those of horn or carapace. You may analyze an existing specimen you encounter, to determine whether it may function as a basic catalyst.</p>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you may prepare any spells during a long rest for which you have a basic catalyst in your possession. When a spell associated with a basic catalyst is cast, one specimen of that catalyst in the caster’s possession is permanently consumed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 5th level, you acquire the ability to create a preserved coriumancy catalyst, a magical item made from a basic coriumancy catalyst that has not yet decayed. You must have appropriate tools and proficiency to preserve the basic catalyst, but the method can vary, and may include crystallization, drying, embalming, encasement in glass, petrification, plastination, smoking, tanning, etc. Improper storage of a preserved catalyst, such as embalming a hand and keeping it in your backpack without protecting it from bludgeoning damage, may result in its dysfunction. You may analyze an existing trinket or other item you encounter, to determine whether it may function as a preserved catalyst.</p>
			<p>Starting at 5th level, during a long rest, you may prepare any spells for which you have an attuned preserved catalyst in your possession as cantrips instead of spells. When a cantrip or spell associated with a preserved catalyst is cast, nothing is consumed (besides a spell slot, if applicable).</p>
